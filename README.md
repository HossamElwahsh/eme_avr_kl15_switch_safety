### AVR Interfacing Project
#### AVR-Based KL15 Car Switch Simulator with battery drain watchdog

#### Description:
> Embark on an innovative journey into embedded systems with our AVR Atmega32 project. We replicate the KL15 car key switch, encompassing Off, Accessory, and On positions, while introducing a battery drain watchdog. This safeguard halts non-essential car electronics after a defined period when the motor isn't engaged, conserving the battery.

> Additionallyâœ¨, we've integrated a light sensor that adapts to the surroundings. Detecting daylight and darkness, it triggers the front lights to ensure optimal visibility and energy efficiency.

**User Stories:**

1. **Commute Confidence:** As a daily commuter, I appreciate the battery drain protection. The system's ability to shut off non-essential electronics when I forget to turn off the key helps me avoid unexpected battery depletion, ensuring a hassle-free start every morning.

2. **Environmental Adaptation:** I often drive through changing light conditions. With the light sensor in place, the car's front lights automatically adjust, making nighttime driving safer and ensuring I don't forget to turn off the lights during the day.

3. **Battery Vigilance:** As a car owner who occasionally forgets to turn off the lights, I'm excited about the battery watchdog. Knowing that the system will take care of preserving battery life by shutting down electronics gives me peace of mind.

4. **Efficiency Enthusiast:** Being conscious of both energy consumption and convenience, I look forward to the system's ability to optimize the front lights. The automatic adjustment not only enhances safety but also aligns with my commitment to sustainable practices.

5. **Tech-Savvy Driver:** As someone who enjoys tinkering with technology, the project's simulation of the KL15 switch intrigues me. I'm excited to explore how microcontrollers can replicate essential car functions and contribute to the evolution of automotive systems.

> Incorporating cutting-edge technology, our project demonstrates how microcontrollers can elevate the driving experience by combining practicality and innovation.
